# DevBootcamp Portfolio Work

This repo is a collection of the challenges and projects I've written throughout my nine [DevBootcamp](http://www.devbootcamp.com). While I am proud of how much I've learnt and the work I've done, I also recognize that much of the code could be refactored and improved. This repo represents the journey and how I've progressed.
