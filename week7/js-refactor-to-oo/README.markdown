## Overview
As a professional programmer, you'll wind up dealing with some very hairy
JavaScript. This challenge asks you to take some procedural code
and refactor it to object oriented JavaScript.

Start with this
[skeleton](http://s3.amazonaws.com/dbc_socrates/challenges/js-refactor-to-oo.zip) and
refactor it.

### Core
Refactor the pile-O Javascript using either Object Literals or Prototypical
Inheritance. Put as little as possible into the global scope!

#### Objectives
1. Provide good names for all anonymous functions.
2. Move the anonymous functions to objects.

#### You Will Know You Are Done When:
Each callback or event handler is only 1 or 2 lines, and you have a clear
seperation of concerns.
