# End Week 5 Reflection

#### Recap

This week was focused on using Javascript, JQuery, and AJAX. As well as the occasional dabble in Active Record and Sinatra.

### Lessons Learned

- Really got the chance to dive deeper into the way JQuery helps you manipulate and handle things. It was fun to be able to change/animate/display stuff on the web page based on the way the user interacts with it. This was an area that I was always curious in learning about it and it was fun to actually be able to do it. Definitely a lot easier that I though.
- AJAX also turned out to be a ton easier than I imagined. While I knew that it allowed you to change specific parts of the web site without needing to reload the page, I didn't realize that it was just a specified request and response. This was really cool.
- I'm realizing that when I right code, I don't always remember the code that I write. So when I want to do it again, I feel like I forgot something, or didn't really learn it. But that's not true, it's not about remember the exact code you wrote but getting more and more comfortable with your tools. It doesn't matter if you don't write the code the exact same way, it's more important if you know what you are trying to do and you can still carry out the solution.

### The Good

- I came into this week feeling pretty good. I felt comfortable with the material and while I knew I had a ton to learn, I finally got to the point where I felt I had more control over my code. It was nice to finally get to the point where you can discuss the major overarching way you want to do something and then feel comfortable enough to just do it without getting stuck in syntax land or trying to figure out of something can be done. The next step is just to be more comfortable so that I can be more expressive and clean in my code about what exactly I'm trying to do.
- Originally, I disliked Javascript just because I though the code looked ugly. Ruby is so much more clean code wise. But after reading about how Javascript really works, I have to say I really like it. Almost more than Ruby.
- I like the way it lives on the client end and when testing it, you can see your results. For me this has made it so much easier to debug.
- I also just like the way you can use CSS accessors or traverse through web page to do cool stuff. This has been really fun for me.

### The Bad

- I felt that I haven't really gotten a great handle on OOJS. This worries me a bit and definitely an area that I want to improve in.
- The downside of this week was that I felt I spent more time on JQuery than Javascript. While JQuery is a great library and has been super useful, I want to also focus on just building my code skills with Javascript.
- One area that I'm trying to improve on and get more comfortable with is writing BAD code. I've recognized that I slow myself down, analysis paralysis, because I over think what's the best way to do this. How can I make this solution elegant. When really I should just spit out code and a solution that works then refactor. I have to be more okay with the BAD code I write so that I can eventually write more good code. It's kind of like writing.

### The Ugly

- Really learning that group dynamics makes a breaks the team. It's surprising how one, hard to work with teammate, can really hurt the team. I wish I could learn the magic secret to make everyone an awesome teammate.
